# Weathrly
Weathrly provides current, hourly, and 7 day weather forecasts for a user-enetered location through the Weather Underground API and was built using create-react-app. Created in a week's time with [Arram Mendel](https://github.com/airum82), Weatherly served as a foray into the react language, as well as an introduction to fetch requests from an external API.
